If you are not familiar yet with Sublime Text package development, please head over to [the Sublime Text documentation](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/index.html) first.
There you will find information on how syntax definitions are implemented and why scopes are named as they are.

## Completions

Completions for procedures of libraries shipped with PureBasic should be implemented as dedicated completion files per library.
This eases maintenance. The one big completions file is a leftover from the predecessor project of language support in Atom.

## Tests

As most as possible should be covered by syntax tests. You can read about them in the Sublime Text documentation.
